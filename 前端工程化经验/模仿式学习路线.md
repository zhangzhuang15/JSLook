# Description
The most effective method to learn how to create a specific App and how to manage your project, is that
1. Find out an existed open source project satisfied with your requirement
2. Write your code by imitating it   
   > in the early period, you might copy their codes, it's ok, you're just a student, don't be shamed!
   > just remember everyone grows up in a specific area by imitating the people who are grown-up!
